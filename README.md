## Counter Web App

This is a simple counter application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface includes three buttons that let a user adjust the counter value:

Increment – increases the counter by 1

Decrement – decreases the counter by 1

Neutral / Reset – sets the counter back to 0

The page uses Bootstrap for layout and styling.
